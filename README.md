# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ (From Brute Force to Optimized)

This repository documents my **DSA journey in C++**, where I systematically solve problems by starting with **brute-force approaches**, then improving them step by step into **optimized solutions**.

The goal is not memorization, but **clear thinking, pattern recognition, and algorithmic improvement**.
